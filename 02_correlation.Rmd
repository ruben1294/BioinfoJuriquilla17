## Replicability of large Pharmacological Studies

Hopefully you have had the chance to explore the features of the CCLE
and GDSC drug response datasets. If not, it might be a good idea to
check out the tutorial on 'Exploratory analysis of pharmacogenomic
data' to get a feel for what types of variables the datasets contain,
and learn about the difference between the raw dataset, which contains
the cell line viability at each drug concentration, and the summarized
dataset, which contains numerical summaries of the cell lines response
to a drug over all concentrations.

In this tutorial we'll learn more about summary measures of drug
response, and then use scatterplots and correlation measures to assess
the agreement of these summary measures in the two studies.

## Summary measurements of drug response

Recall that in the summarized dataset, for each cell line and drug
combination, the cell line viability over all drug concentrations has
been summarized into a single number, which represents the *overall
effect of the drug on the cell line*. Essentially, there are many
different ways this could be done, and our data provides two possible
measures:

1. IC50: the estimated concentration of the drug that will result in half (50%) of the cells surviving. 

![](Figures/IC50.jpg)

Are cell lines with higher IC50 values more or less susceptible? What
about drugs with higher IC50 values - are they more or less toxic?

Answer: cell lines with higher IC50 values are less susceptible to the drug, because it is needed a high concentration of the drug to reach the inhibition of 50% of the cells. Drugs with low IC50 are more toxic, because they can inhibit 50% of the cells with a low concentration.


2. AUC (Area Under the Curve): despite the name, this is actually the
area *above* the curve estimated by the drug concentration and
viability data (or 1-area under the curve). Note that the estimation
of this curve is not a simple task in itself - check out the vignette
on summarizing the relationship between two variables to learn more.

![](Figures/AUC.jpg)

Are cell lines with higher values of AUC more or less resistant?

Are drugs with higher AUC more or less toxic?

## Load the summarized pharmacological dataset into the session
First, we'll read in the .csv file that contains the summarized
pharmacological data (including the IC50 and AUC values for each drug
and cell line combination, as described above).

```{r read csv}
library(PharmPlotter)
data("summarizedData")
cellLinesSummary <- summarizedData
str(cellLinesSummary)

length(unique(cellLinesSummary$cellLine))
length(unique(cellLinesSummary$drug))
```

Notice that there are 2,257 rows - each row here corresponds to a cell
line-drug combination.  Making up these combinations are 288 unique
cell lines, and 15 drugs.

Was every cell line in the dataset tested with every drug?

Definitively no. Combination of 288 with 15 gives a number in the order of 10^24, so I can say that is a number higher than 2257, so I can say that not every cell line was tested with every drug.

## Comparing response of drug AZD0530 in the two studies

So we now have summary measures (IC50 and AUC) that indicate the
responses of cell lines to drugs. However, each study measured these
values separately. The goal of this analysis is to **investigate how
well these two studies agree with each other**. In other words, do the
drug response results in one study **replicate** in the other study?

First, we'll examine this question for one of the drugs in particular:
AZD0530. We'll start out by visually exploring how the AUC values for
AZD0530 compare in the two datasets using a scatterplot.

```{r AUC 1 drug}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(x=auc_GDSC, y=auc_CCLE), data=subset(cellLinesSummary, drug=="AZD0530")) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("GDSC AUC") +
    ylab("CCLE AUC") 
```

Perfect agreement between the GDSC and CCLE AUC values would mean all
the points would fall on a straight line. How would you describe the
level of agreement between the AUC values of drug AZD0530 in the CCLE
and GDSC studies? Does it seem like higher values of AUC in the GDSC
correspond to higher values in the CCLE?

Next, let's look at the same type of scatterplot for the IC50 values.

```{r ic50 1 drug}
ggplot(aes(x=ic50_GDSC, y=ic50_CCLE), data=subset(cellLinesSummary, drug=="AZD0530")) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("GDSC IC50") +
    ylab("CCLE IC50") 
```

What is different about this plot compared to the AUC plot for this
drug above?

First, you may notice that there are many points with the highest
value of IC50 for CCLE. Recall that this study measured a fixed set of
doses, regardless of how the cells responded, whereas in the GDSC drug
concentrations were increased if no response was observed. What does
this mean for the IC50 values in the CCLE? Are they more likely to be
too high or too low? Why?

Another thing to notice is that there is a very large range of IC50
values in the GDSC, but most values are small. This indicates a
*skewed* distribution that may benefit from a
log-transformation. Next, we'll plot log10-transformed values of
IC50. We'll also plot *negative* values, so that increasing values of
IC50 represent increasing drug toxicity (to make the plot more
comparable to the AUC plot above).

```{r ic50 1 drug log}
ggplot(aes(x=-log10(ic50_GDSC), y=-log(ic50_CCLE)), data=subset(cellLinesSummary, drug=="AZD0530")) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") 
```


How would you describe the level of agreement between the IC50 values
of drug AZD0530 in the CCLE and GDSC studies? Does it seem like higher
values of AUC in the GDSC correspond to higher values in the CCLE?

## Comparing summary measures of drug response across all drugs

So far, we have only looked at how well the two studies agree for the
response measurements of a single drug. However, we need to look at
the rest of the drugs to fully assess the level of replication. First,
we set out to reproduce Figure 2 in the Haibe-Kains paper, which
displays scatter plots of IC50 values for the 15 drugs that were
probed in both the CCLE and GDSC. Essentially, we are going to make
the plots from the previous section for all 15 drugs at once and
compare them side-by-side.

```{r Fig2 raw}
ggplot(aes(x=-log10(ic50_GDSC), y=-log10(ic50_CCLE)), data=cellLinesSummary) +
    geom_point(cex=0.5) + 
    facet_wrap(facets=~drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") 
```

Why do the ranges of the axes not exactly match the axes in Figure 2
of the published paper? Note that the concentrations reported in the
`summarizedData` object are given in units of mili-molar, however the
plots contain values calculated on the nano-molar scale (1 million
times smaller). Thus, we can reproduce the original plot's scale by
scaling the concentration values by 10^6.

```{r Fig2 nano}
ggplot(aes(x=-log10(ic50_GDSC/10^6), y=-log10(ic50_CCLE/10^6)), data=cellLinesSummary) +
    geom_point(cex=0.5) + 
    facet_wrap(facets=~drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50/10^6)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50/10^6)") 
```

Compare this plot to Figure 2 in the Haibe-Kains reanalysis
paper. Does it seem to agree?

Looking at the IC50 values for both studies across all 15 drugs, would
you say that they tend to agree? Why or why not?

We have visually inspected the agreement of the drug response data
between the two studies. Now, we'd like to go a step further and
quantify the agreement with statistics. We'll start by exploring
measures of correlation.

## Compare correlations of the drug sensitivity measures

One way to quantify the degree of agreement of two variables is to
calculate the *correlation*. Correlation is a statistic between -1 and
1 that measures the degree of association between two variables. In
this case our two variables are the drug response in CCLE and the drug
response for GDSC. The higher the correlation value, the more the two
variables agree with one other. If two variables are exactly the same,
then the correlation is equal to 1. If two variables are unrelated,
then the correlation value will be close to zero. What would a
negative correlation mean?

When interpreting a correlation value, we consider how close the value
is to 1 (or negative 1). There are no exact rules on calling a
correlation "weak" or "strong", but generally values above around 0.7
in magnitude are considered strong and below around 0.3 in magnitude
are considered weak. Here are some example scatterplots and their
resulting correlation coefficients (using the Pearson method to
calculate - more on this below).

```{r, correlation ex}
# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(738)

# Perfect correlation
x <- rnorm(50)
perfect <- data.frame(x=x, y=x)
cor.coef <- round(cor(perfect$x, perfect$y),2)
ggplot(data=perfect, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Correlation coefficient = ", cor.coef)) + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

# Strong correlation
x <- rnorm(50,0,2)
strong <- data.frame(x=x, y=x+rnorm(50,0,0.75))
cor.coef <- round(cor(strong$x, strong$y),2)
ggplot(data=strong, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Correlation coefficient = ", cor.coef))+ 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

# Moderate correlation
x <- rnorm(50,0,2)
moderate <- data.frame(x=x, y=x+rnorm(50,0,2.5))
cor.coef <- round(cor(moderate$x, moderate$y),2)
ggplot(data=moderate, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Correlation coefficient = ", cor.coef))+ 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

# Weak correlation
x <- rnorm(50,0,1)
weak <- data.frame(x=x, y=x+rnorm(50,0,4))
cor.coef <- round(cor(weak$x, weak$y),2)
ggplot(data=weak, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Correlation coefficient = ", cor.coef))+ 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

# No correlation
x <- rnorm(50,0,2)
none <- data.frame(x=x, y=rnorm(50),0,2)
cor.coef <- round(cor(none$x, none$y),2)
ggplot(data=none, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Correlation coefficient = ", cor.coef))+ 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

```

Note that there are several different types of correlations. For
example, we might say that two variables are in agreement if they fall
along a straight line when plotted against eachother. Or, we might say
they two are in agreement if an increase in one tends to be associated
with an increase in the other (but not necessarily along a straight
line). We'll start by examining two different types:

1. **Pearson's** correlation coefficient: measures the degree of
*linear* association

2. **Spearman's** correlation coefficient: measures the agreement of
the *rankings* of the values of one variable compared to the other.

To understand the difference, here is an example where the two
correlation measures are similar, and an example where they differ
substantially.

```{r, spearman vs pearson}
# Same
x <- rnorm(50,0,1)
corrcomp <- data.frame(x=x, y=x+rnorm(50,0,1))
cor.pearson <- round(cor(corrcomp$x, corrcomp$y, method="pearson"),2)
cor.spearman <- round(cor(corrcomp$x, corrcomp$y, method="spearman"),2)
ggplot(data=corrcomp, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Pearson = ", cor.pearson, ", Spearman = ", cor.spearman))+ 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

# Different
x <- rnorm(50,0,2)
corrcomp <- data.frame(x=x, y=exp(x))
cor.pearson <- round(cor(corrcomp$x, corrcomp$y, method="pearson"),2)
cor.spearman <- round(cor(corrcomp$x, corrcomp$y, method="spearman"),2)
ggplot(data=corrcomp, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(paste0("Pearson = ", cor.pearson, ", Spearman = ", cor.spearman))

```

In the previous example, why is the Spearman correlation so high,
while the Pearson correlation is only moderate?

Now we'll summarize different measures of correlation of the IC50
values to assess the level of replication between these two
experiments. First, we'll compute the two different measures for
correlating continous variables mentioned above (Pearson and Spearman
correlation coefficients).

```{r ic50 correlation}
library(dplyr)

drugCorrs <- cellLinesSummary %>% 
    group_by(drug) %>% summarise(Pearson_ic50=cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC/10^6),-log10(ic50_CCLE/10^6), method="pearson"),
                                 Spearman_ic50=cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC/10^6),-log10(ic50_CCLE/10^6), method="spearman"))

drugCorrs
```

Next, we'll visualize the correlations the IC50 measurements in a grouped bar plot.

```{r barplot correlations ic50}
library(reshape2)
drugCorrs <- melt(drugCorrs)
colnames(drugCorrs) <- c("Drug", "Measure", "Correlation")

drugCorrs_IC50 <- drugCorrs[grep("ic50", drugCorrs$Measure),]
ggplot(data=drugCorrs_IC50, aes(x=Drug, y=Correlation, fill=Measure, group=Measure)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(), colour="black") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_fill_grey()
```
